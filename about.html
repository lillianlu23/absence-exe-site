  <h1>About the Exhibition</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>In Between: Absence.exe</strong> is a virtual exhibition exploring the aesthetics of negative space, absence, and perception through immersive online experience.
    It invites the audience to become active participants in an environment defined not by what is shown, but by what is held back.  
    The exhibition blurs the line between presence and lack, inviting each visitor to slow down, discover hidden meaning, and explore a system where absence is a form of design.
